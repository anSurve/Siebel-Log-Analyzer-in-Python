# Siebel-Log-Analyzer-in-Python

Welcome, and thank you for opening this project. Debugging logs is a crucial process in development and maintenance of large applications. Siebel is one of those large applications, with vast variety of features and resultingly vast amount of code.
This app can help in the process of Siebel log analysis. This app basically reads log file, lists all the events happened, all the workflows got invoked on back of each event, all the steps getting executed in a workflow.
For each of these separate objects are created and the logs / SQLs queries generated on back of each of these are displayed in the below applet.
